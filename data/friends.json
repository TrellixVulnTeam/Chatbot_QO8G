{"line": "Oh my God! Oh my God!", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Yeah. We figured when we couldn\u0092t find you, you\u0092d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "You think?! God, I, ah, I\u0092m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel\u0092s all like, \u0091I love you and, and let\u0092s work on this.\u0092 And all I can think about is, \u0091What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?\u0092 when I tell her what I did.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "What?! Look, we\u0092re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "He\u0092s right. Nobody\u0092s gonna benefit, and you\u0092re just gonna hurt her.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Yeah, and there won\u0092t be a relationship left to rebuild.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Yeah, but don\u0092t you think....", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing\u0092s right. And that\u0092s what deathbeds are for.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Yeah, okay.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn\u0092t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "What trail?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Oh, I-I don\u0092t think there\u0092s any trail.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac\u0092s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe\u0092s friends with Rachel. And that\u0092s the trail, I did it!", "role": "Chandler:"},

{"line": "Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "Oh, hey, man I know, doesn\u0092t matter how much we love \u0091em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.", "role": "Issac:"},
{"line": "Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We\u0092re the same, you and me.", "role": "Issac:"},

{"line": "No.", "role": "Jasmine:"},

{"line": "For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Yeah, well I don\u0092t think you can make that statement, unless you\u0092ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that\u0092s all. I mean, come on, it\u0092s just a little wax.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "We were on a break!", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "You think you\u0092re gonna get out of this on a technicality?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Look, I\u0092m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Y'know what, I don\u0092t think we should listen to this anymore.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "What, what are you doing? You can\u0092t go out there.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Why not?!  I\u0092m hungry.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Because they\u0092ll know we\u0092ve been listening.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn\u0092t happen!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Oh, that is so sweet. I think I\u0092m falling in love with you all over again.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Yes.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it\u0092s, I mean it\u0092s you.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Ohhhhh!", "role": "All:"},
{"line": "What? Come on Rach, tell me what you\u0092re thinking?", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "Order a pizza like, \u0091I forgive you?\u0092", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "We could eat the wax! It\u0092s organic.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Oh great, food with hair on it.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "No, not the used wax.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Because", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I\u0092m kinda hungry myself.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Fine.  Hi! Yes, I\u0092d like to order a large pizza.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "No anchovies.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "With ah, extra anchovies.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "That\u0092s okay, I\u0092ll just pick \u0091em off.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "You can have the last piece, if you want.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "You think I need a new walk?", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "What?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Well y'know, I\u0092ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a \u0091take notice\u0092 walk.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Are you actually saying these words?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "What, now you\u0092re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I\u0092m sorry, okay, I\u0092m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I\u0092d lost you, I didn\u0092t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don\u0092t cheat right, I, that\u0092s not me, I\u0092m not Joey!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Hey. It\u0092s three in the morning. They don\u0092t know that I\u0092ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Y'know what, y'know what, I\u0092m-I\u0092m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You\u0092re the one that bailed on us. You\u0092re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "That\u0092s....", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "That's really nice.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.", "role": "Gavin:"},
{"line": "Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm    sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he    was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "What do you think brought than on?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the    fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Olivia.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right,    real life more important.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "So do you think that my dream means anything?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe    you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know    what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "You took the same class twice.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening    to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out    of the vault.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I    just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Ok, we're still on that.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "I didn't say your songs were not good enough.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny    portions of pretentious food?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Tiny portions?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,    but  I can't see it, I can't see it\"!", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "So, how did", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "You really liked it?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because    as a man I've been trained", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Oh really!", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through    as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!", "role": "Chandler:"},

{"line": "Oh I\u2019m kinda part of this.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda  thing", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "I knew I should have married Chandler.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from    you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come    join me up here!", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides,    why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career    now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe    we could wait a little while.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Like a month?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Or a year?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Really, you want to wait a year?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff.    \"Pants. Like shorts, but longer.\"  It'll probably be more than a year.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "I really wanna have a baby.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis    and data reconfiguration.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I quit and you learn what I do?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have    a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new    job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do    this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Phoebe, it's not about quantity.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Well...it's not about quality.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of    a key? It's what some people sing in.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there    are other ingredients Monica.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee    house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing    at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales    are going up like crazy.", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm    Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. ..    Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick    question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's    singing outside?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Ok, ok, how many of you", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought    the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious    comma garlicky?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention    never hurt anyone?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was    fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was    so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her    friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Oh, you're so wonderful.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!", "role": "David:"},

I just\u0097I wish I didn\u0092t feel this way about Rachel anymore, y\u0092know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think\u0085I think Ross feels left out. Y\u0092know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God\u0085 You should\u0092ve seen the look on Ross\u0092s face.  By the way, I have no idea what I\u0092m doing here.

{"line": "Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa\u0085.  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y\u0092know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.", "role": "Monica:"},

I wanna make sure it\u0092s perfect.", "role": "Chandler:"},

{"line": "See that\u0092s where I think that you\u0092re wrong. We\u0092ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "What do you mean?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y\u0092know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around", "role": "Chandler:"},

{"line": "ON A CAT??!!!!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "It's not a cat!", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?", "role": "Judge:"},

I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.\u00a0 So she didn't want to sue him. \u00a0 Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious.

{"line": "Huh.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn", "role": "Chandler:"},

That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!", "role": "Chandler:"},

{"line": "Don\u0092t say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we\u0085 were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "... And where's this money coming from?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "What kind of research?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Oh, just, y'know.... science.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "You're okay there?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok?  Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "There might be\u0085a teeny\u0085tiny\u0085possibility.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "I can't believe you caved.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "What?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself?  Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "I am. Let me just get my coat.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Phoebe, tell her!", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Neat. I'm gonna die alone.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Ok, you win.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Uh huh. Why is that?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y\u0092know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they'll shout!", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Do we have to know about that?", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.", "role": "Joey:"},
{"line": "Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "What, it's ok when Chandler does it?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "You have to pick your moments.", "role": "Chandler:"},

{"line": "She's not even here yet.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "What's with the guitar?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Where the hell have you been?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "We stopped at the gift shop.", "role": "Susan:"},
{"line": "I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.", "role": "Joey and Ross:"},

{"line": "No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "So, uh, why didn't you say anything?", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Okay, okay, what's going on?", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "What? What? What?!", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler!  I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone.  Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.  Okay.   She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.

{"line": "Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Yes, but there isn't always time!", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "Hey. We found her, we found the girl.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "What?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Did you call the cops?", "role": "Joey:"},

This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.", "role": "Rachel:"},

So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me.
