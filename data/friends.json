{"line": "Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.", "role": "Gavin:"},
{"line": "That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know    that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had    a deap meaningful relationship.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Huh. What's Tag's last name?", "role": "Gavin:"},
{"line": "It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last    name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "But it was a deap meaningful relationship.", "role": "Gavin:"},

{"line": "What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious    kind of way.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there    in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me    feel like I earned it.", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "So do you think that my dream means anything?", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know    what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out    of the vault.", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing    at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales    are going up like crazy.", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common    with. You know what I mean?", "role": "Charlie:"},
{"line": "Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey    a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Yeah, I guess that's true.", "role": "Charlie:"},
{"line": "And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the    kind of guy Joey is.", "role": "Ross:"},

And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get    wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look,    if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him.

{"line": "Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.", "role": "Chandler:"},

Yeah ok, there's    this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake    wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't...

And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants    to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings    before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is...    beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could    never tell you  but it was worth    it just to be there looking at you.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation,    you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then    Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side    of him!", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "I'll watch her.", "role": "Gavin:"},
{"line": "Why would you do that?", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "That's really nice.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.", "role": "Gavin:"},
{"line": "What?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's    like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground    because he secretly had a crush on me?", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "So this is what a stroke feels like.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility    now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're    a mother.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed    them.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box    of rats?", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone    can afford help.", "role": "Phoebe:"},

Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?

{"line": "That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career    now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe    we could wait a little while.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Like a month?", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Or a year?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Really, you want to wait a year?", "role": "Monica:"},

There's always gonna be a reason not to do    this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.", "role": "Monica:"},

I mean, the apartment's    gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the    ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon    drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the    ribbons go!?!", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.", "role": "Phoebe:"},
{"line": "Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a \"love    the one you're with\" kind of animals.", "role": "Mike:"},

{"line": "Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let    the box of rats ruin our lives.", "role": "Mike:"},
{"line": "Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just    give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins.    They're Bob's favorites.", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "No, I think you're sweet.", "role": "Mike:"},
{"line": "Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.    I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to    my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't    told you about that yet, have I?", "role": "Phoebe:"},

{"line": "What?!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "No! No-no theyre not. Theyre still very angry! But yknow Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.", "role": "Monica:"},
{"line": "Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!", "role": "Monica:"},

{"line": "We heard you play all the way from your apartment!", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Were you the ones called the cops?!", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Thats not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Why not?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Because we hate them.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play!", "role": "Ross:"},

{"line": "What?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Okay! Yknow what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.", "role": "Phoebe:"},

And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.

{"line": "Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up?", "role": "Rachel:"},

But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "Hey.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Do I look fat?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Noo.", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Nooo!", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "And it works both ways.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Okay, so you both just know this stuff?", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "That's easy, baggage claim.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.", "role": "Rachel:"},
{"line": "Oh.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "All right are you guys gonna come down?", "role": "Rachel:"},

{"line": "Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Yeah.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "I'm gonna use the cushion.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Yeah.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.", "role": "Ross:"},
{"line": "Okay, the old hug and roll.", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'", "role": "Chandler:"},
{"line": "And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'", "role": "Joey:"},

{"line": "Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.", "role": "Joey:"},

This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.
